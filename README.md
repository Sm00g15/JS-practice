Practicing Javascript with mini projects

I've found this to be an excellent resource of resources (see what I did there ;D) for learning JS. I'm finishing up Practical Javascript with Gordon Zhu, as well as Modern Javascript from the Beginning by Brad Traversy. Shortly after I'll take Wes Bos' Javascript 30 challenge, and then move on to the items listed below. Probably start with Egghead.io and React.

This will be a good place for us to build small stuff in Javascript and gradually work our way into more complex stuff.
